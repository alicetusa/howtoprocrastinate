		<h3>Its probably a Monday, and its at least 3pm. You've wasted an hour and a half at lunch, got settled for half an hour in the library and the <b>BAM</b> you've got distracted...</h3>

		<center><p>But, in fact, you're actually doing this:</p>
		<img src='asleepondesk.jpeg' class='img-circle'></center>
		<p>So, first things first, lets be honest, you're definitely not getting any work done at least not for a couple of hours. So lets make this procrastination mildly useful...</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You've probably types <a href='www.facebook.com'> Facebook</a> into the search bar before you've even realised. So you go through your timeline, clicking on pictures of friends you haven't talked to in a while, stalking that fit boy/girl/animal. Because of curiosity and whatnot. Which leads to you clicking on a stranger's album, even though you don't know anyone else in it, but the album is not that entertaining, mostly because you don't know anyone else in it, so...</li>
			<li>You move onto <a href='www.instagram.com'>Instagram</a> promising you'll get back to work straight after. But then you start to get scared that you might accidentally double-clikc on a photo whilst trying to zoon and then everyone will know you were stalking this person, so you move onto <a href='www.twitter.com'>Twitter</a> where it's a bit safer.</li>
			<li>But let's be honest. No one really cares what anyone can say in 140 characters. So, you're trying to get back to the task in hand so you inevitably end up on <a href='www.imhavinganessaycrisis.co.uk'>THE MOST RELEVANT WEBSITE EVER</a> because, well, you probably relate to it a bit too much...</li>
			<li>Right, finally time to get back to work. But, you're hungry and no one can work on an empty stomach. So now you're trying to think of the perfect meal. But Sainsbury's and Pret are so far away so you decide to settle fora  coffee, and suddenly you're weighing up the pros and cons of Nero over starbucks:</li>
		<table align=center>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Chain</th>
					<th>Pros</th>
					<th>Cons</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Starbucks</td>
					<td>Christmas cards, longer queues (more time wasted)</td>
					<td>More expensive, more tourists.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nero</td>
					<td>Loyalty cards, christmas drinks</td>
					<td>Smaller cups, too milky</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
			<li>So you finally decided on Nero, and now you're back in the library but you've go the shakes and that stupid Christmas song <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnIqLlBwzrc'>'rockin' around the christmas tree</a>they were playing in your head. You decide the only way to get it out of your head is to go on youtube and listen to <a href='https://owa.nexus.ox.ac.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=QznTA3QiFEqy2M4sJlnDkQSGm8m129EILCxJHqz1tX8oUZzpMg3GkYBU4IMZh3LyzrQzkRm1SUE.&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3doMnUm9o-mhg'>Best movie soundtracks</a>.</li>
			<li>And the, before you know it, you're watching the Kate and Leo in Titanic on the verge of tears lamenting that you will never meet anyone as good looking as Leo.</li>
			<center><img src='titanic.jpg' class='img-circle'></center>
			<li>To make yourself feel better about your lonely life you are on <a href='http://www.buzzfeed.com/leonoraepstein/heres-what-your-favorite-child-actors-look-like-now'>Buzzfeed</a> seeing what happened to your favorite child actors.</li>
			<li>So now you're thinking what even is the point in all this if they can't make it, then how the hell can I?... Its time to google inspirational quotes</li>

	        <div class='col-sm-4'>
	          <div>
	            <img src='cslewisquote.jpeg' class='img-circle' class='text-center'>
	          </div>
	        </div>
	        <div class='col-sm-4'>
	          <div>
	            <img src='everydayisasecondchance.jpeg' class='img-circle' class='text-center'>
	          </div>
	        </div>
	        <div class='col-sm-4'>
	          <div>
	            <img src='inspirationalquote.jpeg' class='img-circle' class='text-center'>
	          </div> 
	        </div>
	   		</div>
			</div>

			<li>Hell, why not listen to some inspirational songs, so you're back on YouTube, and listening to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CISzjeS3J8'>I just can't wait to be king</a> except your suddently remember that you're in the library and so now you're doing that weird mouthing thing.</li>
			<li>After listening to that song, you see <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4efZIHtiQQ'>The Circle of Life</a> on the sidebar and you're not, NOT, <bold>NOT</bold> going to listen to that...Anyway this makes you think why doesn't anyone ever know the lyrics?</li>
			<li> So you decide to look up the <a href='http://www.lionking.org/lyrics/OMPS/CircleOfLife.html'>lyrics</a> to better educate yourself, and it turns out that its actually Nants Ingonyama Bahithi Baba, and in your googling you learn...</li>
			<li> Well, hey, at least you've learnt something. Probably not that useful for your tute, which suddenly makes you remember you're meant to be working but oh man you're so tired.</li>
			<li>Its not going to rain which sucks because now there really is a reason to go and get those books from the library. But, it is so cold which reminds you, you need gloves so now you're on <a href='www.asos.com'>ASOS</a> trying to buy gloves, but there are no opinions so you google 'gloves in style'...</li>
			<li>And of course Blake Lively comes up which is a huge problem because now you're on images and she's so damn perfectwith her perfect man, and perfect hair, and perfect baby bymp. And now you're mad and hungry, oh so hungry, but you're reminiscing how great Gossip Girl was when you hadn't seen every single one, and then you remember its all on Netflix which is so bad and so easy...</li>
